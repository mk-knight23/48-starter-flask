# Design System: 23-flask-starter

## Visual Philosophy
The design follows a **High-Octane Accelerator / Micro-Backend** aesthetic. It uses a "Deep Navy" foundation (#0a192f) with vibrant "Flask Coral" (custom HSL tokens) accents, focusing on kinetic energy, speed indicators, and technical transparency.

## Design Patterns
-   **Glass Panels**: Semi-transparent containers with internal 10% white boundaries and high-intensity backdrop blurs (20px+).
-   **Neon Borders**: Glow-heavy 1px boundaries (Flask-Coral) that simulate high-energy data pipelines.
-   **Accelerator HUD**: Large, bold statistical displays (Stats grid) with high-contrast font weights.
-   **Kinetic Hover**: Scale-based interaction (1.05x) and shadow-expansion for primary action buttons.

## Color Palette
-   **Deep Navy**: Base Foundation (#0a192f)
-   **Flask Coral/Red**: Primary Accent (Custom HSL)
-   **SSL Emerald**: Security Indicator (#34d399)
-   **Telemetry Blue**: Secondary Accent (#2563eb)

## Interaction Design
-   **Neon Pulse**: Pulsing status indicators to signify active backend availability.
-   **Terminal Reveal**: Monospaced code blocks with sequential line fades to simulate software initialization.
-   **Edge Bounce**: Deliberate bounce animations on floating HUD elements to indicate real-time data persistence.
