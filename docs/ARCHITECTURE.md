# Architecture: 23-flask-starter

## Overview
A lightweight, high-performance full-stack starter kit integrating Flask (Backend) and React 19 (Frontend). It follows a "Micro-Backend Accelerator" philosophy, focusing on minimal overhead, extreme routing speed, and rapid API deployment.

## Tech Stack
-   **Frontend**: React 19
-   **Build Tool**: Vite 6
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
-   **Animations**: Framer Motion 12
-   **Backend**: Python / Flask (intended for micro-service orchestration)

## Core Logic
-   **FlaskHub Engine**: Conceptual API layer designed for extreme Request/Sec performance and sub-12ms cold starts.
-   **Async Runtime**: Support for modern asynchronous Python patterns (envisioned as v4.2+).
-   **Frontend Dispatcher**: React 19 dashboard providing telemetry, documentation access, and deployment triggers.
-   **Edge Optimization**: Built-in visual indicators for CDN edge distribution and SSL verification.

## Performance
-   Native React 19 rendering for zero-latency UI interactions.
-   Tailwind v4 native engine for optimized component styling.
-   Advanced CSS backdrop filters and neon-glow border systems for a high-end "Accelerator" aesthetic.
